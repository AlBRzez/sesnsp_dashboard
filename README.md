# Crime rates in Mexico dashboard
This is the code and some catalogues used to create a shiny dashboard to show crime rates in Mexico using data from the ["Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad PÃºblica"](https://www.gob.mx/sesnsp). This data is updated monthly with information sent by all the states in Mexico.  

## Dashboard
The dashboard is deployed [here](https://albrz.shinyapps.io/app_secretariado/).
